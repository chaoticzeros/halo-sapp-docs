Troubleshooting
=================


Common Startup Errors
-----------------------

1. *Requested function "load" cannot be executed now.*

    The SAPP strings.dll file is not present.
    You need to make sure that SAPP's strings.dll is present, and not the Halo dedicated server's strings.dll file.

2. *Failed to load sapp.dll!*

   Check to make sure the sapp.dll file is in the server folder with the server executable.
   If it is, check to make sure it's the correct sapp.dll file and that your file permissions aren't preventing you from opening it.

3.  *Failed to open data cache file*
    
    You have not copied the maps folder to your Halo dedicated server folder.

Commands
=========

SAPP provides a variety of commands to be used by both hosts, administrators, and players.
Each command has a minimum admin level in order to be invoked.
Like in stock Halo, SAPP command names can be autocompleted by pressing TAB.

**These commands are subject to change in future SAPP versions.**

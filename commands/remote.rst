Remote Console
==============

The remote console API allows you to remotely manage your servers without needing to use the serverâ€™s main console.
For your convenience, the remote console commands are listed twice: once in the Configuration Commands section and once here, in the Remote Console
section.

   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 0


   * - **Command Usage**
     - **Effect**

   * - remote_console[enabled]
     - Enabling this will enable the remote console.
       *Default: false*

   * - remote_console_list
     - List all connected players currently connected through the remote console.

   * - remote_console_port[port]
     - Set the TCP port of the remote console.
       Using this command will require restarting the remote console to take effect.
       *Default: Port for the Halo server*


The remote console uses the name and password based admin system where the password is MD5-hashed *(yes, I bugged him and he still stuck with MD5 for
backward compatibility)*.
Command permissions work as expected: level 2 admins can neither execute level 3 nor level 4 commands using the remote console.

**The rest of this section is a little bit more technical and is designed to help you create a remote console client.
If you just want to use remote console, there are pre-existing clients out there on sites like Open Carnage** (http://opencarnage.net).

**The SAPP site also has a web client:** http://halo.isimaginary.com/remote_console/

The remote console uses TCP, and every request is a JSON structure terminated with a single line feed character (\\n) and parsed upon receipt.

To do anything, the client has to log in, first.

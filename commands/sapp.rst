   * - load
     - This command is used for loading SAPP and is immediately available when strings.dll is enabled.
       This command will fail if sapp.dll is not present.
       This command cannot be used while SAPP is loaded.

   * - reload
     - This command will reload SAPPâ€™s configuration settings and any SAPP scripts from the SAPP folder.
       This is faster than using *unload* and then *load*.

   * - unload
     - This command will unload SAPP, essentially reverting the game back to stock.
       This is useful if you want to manually update.
       This command can only be executed from the server console or from rcon.
